# Conky Configuration.

Now that I have moved to the faster laptop I can indulge in some eye
candy.

Conky is a way of displaying various bits of information about your
system. It takes a bit of fiddling to get it working the way that
people want it. I have mine set up so that it has some simple
information including:

- Useful aliases reminder

- Time

- Uptime

- CPU load (as a horizontal bar)

- File system use (root and home)

- Wi-fi network name, up and down speeds and a simple graph of up and
  down speeds.

The information can be displayed using all sorts of prettiness, but
I've just gone for a simple white text embedded as a transparent layer
on the lower right hand of the screen. It looks best when the
wallpaper is dark. 

When adding the aliases information I decided to remove the CPU
and memory usage information. My current laptop has a lot of memory
available and a powerful processor so the usage information is pretty
moot at this point. This meant there was a bit more space to up the
time and date information font size. More tweaking on available space
on the file system may be a good idea as I have plenty of disc space,
and the same information is available on the i3bar anyway.
