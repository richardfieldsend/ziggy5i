# Configuration Files for Dell Latitude i5 Laptop.

## Introduction.

I'm currently working on migrating from an older Dell laptop running Linux Mint 20.2 to a newer Dell i5 running Linux
Mint 20.3.

The installation is based on a the Xfce window manager, but I use the i3 tiling window manager for my day to day use. The
availability of the Xfce option is useful while I'm getting things set up as I can log in using Xfce and then fiddle with
setting up these configuration files as appropriate.

The progress will be recorded here, and the progress will be uploaded to Github at various stages.

## Configuring i3 as my window manager.

I really like using i3 as my desktop interface. It is fast, makes good use of the available screen real estate, and suits the
way I like to work with different desktops used for different purposes. I have moved on from the vanilla i3, and implemented
some nice ricing such as putting gaps between the windows, tweaking the i3 bar and using rofi rather than the dmenu.
