# Configuration Files for Dell Latitude i5 Laptop.

## Introduction.

I'm currently working on migrating from an older Dell laptop running
Linux Mint 20.2 to a newer Dell i5 running Linux Mint 20.3.

The installation is based on a the Xfce window manager, but I use the
i3 tiling window manager for my day to day use. The availability of
the Xfce option is useful while I'm getting things set up as I can log
in using Xfce and then fiddle with setting up these configuration
files as appropriate.

The progress will be recorded here, and the progress will be uploaded
to Github at various stages.

## Configuring i3 as my window manager.

I really like using i3 as my desktop interface. It is fast, makes good
use of the available screen real estate, and suits the way I like to
work with different desktops used for different purposes. I have moved
on from the vanilla i3, and implemented some nice ricing such as
putting gaps between the windows, tweaking the i3 bar and using rofi
rather than the dmenu.
